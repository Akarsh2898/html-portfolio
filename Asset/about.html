<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ayush Pandey and I am a student learning new coding-related skills. I aspire to be a fully skilled 
  coder and develop different kinds of projects in the future. What fascinates me is that there are languages that
  command computers and make them do different kinds of things. I want to pursue my coding journey and make a good 
  living.
  As a kid, I always admired the people who used to code. It was so fascinating to see people code and build incredible 
  projects.</p>

<p>I have completed my schooling from Kendriya Vidhyala of Delhi's Dwarka Sec-5. And I am currently studying Btech from 
  SRM University Delhi NCR. 
  This is the first website I have built as a project while learning website development. This is just a basic portfolio 
  made only by using HTML. </p> 

<p>I will be uploading more of my work in the future, and I hope that the quality of the website will continue to improve. Creating a 
website is very interesting, as we explore the work and language behind incredible websites.</p>
